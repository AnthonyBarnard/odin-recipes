        <p>I hope you all enjoy this Key lime pie recipe. When I moved from Lebanon to Florida in the spring of 1999, I brought my love for cooking and searched for new recipes. The famous Key lime pie was new to me. It was a friend's best dessert, and he used to buy it from Costco every time we went shopping. I tasted the pie at several places, but they were missing that wow flavor. I kept playing with the recipe and finally got the right flavor. I now live in North Bay, Ontario, where we only get Key limes twice a year, so sometimes I substitute them with fresh lime juice.</p>
