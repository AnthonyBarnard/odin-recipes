# odin-recipes
Odin Recipes is a website built as part of the Odin Project's lesson on HTML Foundations. 

Each webpage demonstrates basic HTML structures, such as headings, lists, and paragraphs. Both local and external resources are embedded, with relative paths linking website pages together and absolute paths to images illustrating each web page.
